## AVL Tree
An AVL tree (named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST). 
Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. 
Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.
#### Purpose:
To implement the AVL tree algorithm.
#### Specifications:

## Knights Tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 × 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.
#### Purpose:
To write a program that will implement Warnsdorff’s algorithm for finding a generalized knight’s tour on a chessboard. 
#### Specifications:  
Input the size of the board, the starting square for the knight, and the legal moves for the knight.
There often comes a time when the algorithm provides a choice of equally good moves. In such a case
choose the move that comes last in the input list of legal moves.

## Sort Algorithms
#### Purpose:
To implement various sorting algorithms and test them against java.sort algorithm
